# Git Notes (Mac Version)
These are my notes on Git use. Git on Mac OS will be used through the Terminal.

To see notes about the Terminal and how to access it, look at the terminal notes in this folder.

# First step, install Git
Before we start using Git, we need to install it! Go to the Git website, download it, then install it!

[Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Once installed, let's check if it works! In your terminal, type:
```
git
```
You should see a bunch of Git commands that you can look over. Great! It works!

# Set up
First things first, let's set up our user name!
```
git config --global user.name "Jim Yoon"
git config --global user.email jimyoon90@gmail.com
```
To verify:
```
git config --global --list
```
